# MINECRAFT FISHING BOT

Hello, my name is EscasanN and this is my Minecraft Fishing Bot.

This script works in Minecraft Java version. For it to work yo need to have the game in English (American) and have the subtitles active.
The script automatically starts fishing when it's not and pulls the fish when it catches it. The only thing you have to do is to have a fishing rod in your hand and be looking at water.

It's basically an AFK fisher.

Enjoy :)
